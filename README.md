## Summary
- As the "Silver Tsunami" begins to make an impact, 90,396 roles will need to be filled. 
- there are only 1549 employees who would be qualified to become mentors. I say "only" because there are over 300,000 employees to be mentored, so recruiting 1549 mentors for over 300,000 employees would be inadequete.
